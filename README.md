# WeatherWare
A local weather condition tweeting script made in Python using WeatherAPI and Tweepy!
Visit <a href"https://twitter.com/WeatherwareBot"> @WeatherwareBot </a> on Twitter for daily weather updates for Lowell, MA generated by out bot!

Developed in collaboration with my good friend <a href="https://github.com/dhsavoie"> David Savoie </a>

config.py stores all of the necessary API keys and location information needed to generate such tweets, and should be filled in with your own personal API keys and zip code for function. WeatherAPI keys can be obtained with a free account on www.weatherapi.com, and Twitter API keys can be obtained by applying for a free developer account with Twitter.
